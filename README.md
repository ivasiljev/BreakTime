# BreakTime
Multiplatform desktop application for time management that based on Pomodoro
Application written with useing of C# language. To develope program's GUI Avalonia library was used. Why avalonia. Because it is most popular .NET C# multiplatform package for desktop GUI development. Also Avalonia is based on WPF. And highly compatible with MVVM pattern based development that is used in this application.
For testing XUnit and Moq technologies chosen to use.
(P. S. For a while BreakTime is not migrated to Avalonia from Windows Forms right now but it will soon)
